Installation -   
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn   
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow  
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.  
If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.   
  
Usage - This project can be helpul to understand the job scenario of the data science domain. It can be used to extract meaningful insights from the salaries of various job profiles across the globe. It can also be considered as a stepping stone to predict the data science salaries.
